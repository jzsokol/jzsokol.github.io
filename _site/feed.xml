      Who I Am


Hi! I am Joseph Sokol. My work expertise is focused on the application of artificial intelligence in cardiology, scientific, technical and commercial. But, more than that, I’m a serial web entrepreneur, tech visionary, published scientist, writer, classical pianist and ex-professional bike racer.  I am the founder of iCardio.ai and OlehPay.

I have taken an atypical path, having drop...

      Neural networks are becoming the 0,1 operators of programs.
With exponential growth in computational capability, entire neural networks will eventually become the basic, though incredibly elastic, 0,1 operators of programs.
Many may be aware that the basics of computing rely on the logical operator of true or false, classically represented as 0 and 1. Fewer may be aware, however, that a neuron,...

      On January 30, 2017, Jorge Wagnesberg published his article “La Muerte en Aforismos”1–“Death in Aphorisms”–in El Pais, the same newspaper that, just one year later, called Jorge the “Einstein of Spain” in an obituary celebrating his life2. Jorge was my cousin and part of the generation of our family that survived the holocaust through the foresight of his father’s brother who moved to Barcelona...
